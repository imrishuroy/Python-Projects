Q. How to find the sum of digits of a positive integer number using recursion ?

Step 1: Recursive case - the flow

    10 - 10 / 10 = 1 and Remainder = 0
    54 = 54 / 10 = 5 and Remainder = 4
    112 = 112 / 10 = 11 and Remainder = 2
          11 / 10 = 1 and Remainder = 1

       f(n) = n % 10 + f(n/10)

Step 2: Base case - the stopping criterion

    n = 0

Step 3: Unintensionl case - the constraint
