Fibonacci Numbers - Recursion

Fibonacci sequence is the sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two
preceding once and the sequence start from 0 and 1

Eg - 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89

Step 1: Recursive case - the flow

    5 = 3 + 2   f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)

Step 2: Base case - the stopping criterion
    0 and 1

Step 3: Unintentional case - the constraints
    It can't ne negative or decimal
    fibonacci(-1) ??
    fibonacci(1.2) ??
